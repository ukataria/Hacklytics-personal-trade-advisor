We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks Surging on News and Analyst Calls. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks surging on news and analyst calls. The interest in Chinese AI startup DeepSeek remains strong, and the company itself is actively fueling its momentum. In the latest news, the company has announced that it is going to make its models’ code publicly available. The move reaffirms its commitment to open-sourcing artificial intelligence. Posting on social media platform X, the company said that its “tiny team” will open-source 5 code repositories next week. They describe the move as “small but sincere progress” and promise to share “with full transparency.” READ NOW: 10 Buzzing AI Stocks Dominating Headlines and 15 AI Stocks Every Investor Should Be Watching “These humble building blocks in our online service have been documented, deployed and battle-tested in production.” Code repositories are storage locations where developers may see and contribute to software development. They are typically published in centralized hosting services like Microsoft’s GitHub. While they may contain key company assets, DeepSeek’s V3 and R1 models were open-source which implied anyone can see or modify them for free, leading to the rapid rise and success of the startup. “As part of the open-source community, we believe that every line shared becomes collective momentum that accelerates the journey…Daily unlocks are coming soon…No ivory towers – just pure garage-energy and community-driven innovation.” Unlike many US rival firms that tend to lean toward closed-sourced models, the company has been unique given its commitment to open-source. DeepSeek’s Liang Wenfeng said last July how the firm did not prioritize commercializing its AI models. He further noted that there was soft power to be gained from open source. “Having others follow your innovation gives a great sense of accomplishment. In fact, open source is more of a cultural behavior than a commercial one, and contributing to it earns us respect”. With the new open-source code, DeepSeek will be providing the infrastructure to support the AI models that it has already publicly shared. Earlier, the company had also published a study with founder and CEO Liang Wenfeng one of the 15 co-authors. It discussed “native sparse attention”, which is designed to improve LLM efficiency in processing large data sets.

The firm maintained a Buy rating and a $265 price target on the stock. Overall, AAPL ranks 4th on our list of AI stocks surging on news and analyst calls.

Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) sold its entire positions in both the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) during the fourth quarter of 2024, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings released last week, as the investment giant continues its longest selling streak in years. The decision to fully exit both leading exchange-traded funds rather than maintain smaller positions comes as Berkshire accumulates its largest-ever cash reserve, suggesting Warren Buffett sees limited opportunities in the current market environment despite the S&P 500's strong performance. The conglomerate sold its entire stake of 39,400 shares in SPY valued at $22.6 million and 43,000 shares of VOO worth $22.68 million, according to a 13F filing. The sales occurred during a quarter when the S&P 500 gained 2.4% and finished 2024 with a 25% return. "While we don't have insight into their exact reasoning, this could indicate concerns about market valuations, increased volatility, or even a shift toward individual stock selection over broad index exposure," according to Daniel Milks, founder of Fiduciary Organization & Woodmark Advisors. The relatively small positions represented just a fraction of Berkshire's massive portfolio, but the timing of the complete exit from both funds has caught analysts' attention. "Large investment firms often 'clean up' their portfolios by exiting smaller positions that don't significantly impact overall performance," Melissa Caro, founder of My Retirement Network, told etf.com. The sales align with Berkshire's broader strategy of reducing equity exposure, as the company has been a net seller of stocks for nine consecutive quarters, according to the SEC filings. Since these fillings only reflect last year's fourth quarter positions, any potential new moves Berkshire has made in 2025 won't be known until future disclosures. "What's more notable is that Berkshire sold significant stakes in individual companies that make up a large portion of these ETFs and the broader indices they track. That's where the real attention should be," Caro said. "Selling SPY and VOO doesn't necessarily imply a bearish market outlook, but trimming major individual holdings could signal something about Berkshire's view on specific stocks or sectors." Caro noted that Buffett typically recommends index funds for individual investors while pursuing a different strategy for Berkshire, reflecting the distinct advantages and resources available to the institutional investor. "Given Warren Buffett's history of emphasizing long-term investing, this isn't necessarily a warning sign for retail investors to panic," Milks explained. "Instead, it may reflect Berkshire's preference for direct stock holdings or a belief that certain sectors within the S&P 500 are overvalued." In the ongoing battle for ETF market share, SPY has since reclaimed its position as the largest ETF with $636.6 billion in assets, despite experiencing $2.1 billion in outflows over the past five days, according to etf.com data. Meanwhile, VOO has reached $635.2 billion in assets under management, attracting $1 billion in net inflows during the same period. Rather than simply reducing exposure to one fund, Berkshire's complete exit from both exchange-traded funds comes alongside the accumulation of a record-breaking cash reserve exceeding $300 billion, according to the SEC filings, suggesting a cautious stance amid current market valuations. The conglomerate has also reduced holdings in financial institutions like Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Citigroup Inc. (C), while maintaining its substantial Apple Inc. (AAPL) position, which remains its largest single-stock investment.  Permalink | © Copyright 2025 etf.com. All rights reserved Sign in to access your portfolio

Elon Musk’s unsolicited $97 billion bid for OpenAI‘s assets has created a valuation challenge for the artificial intelligence leader, potentially complicating its planned transition to a for-profit structure. Legal experts suggest the offer, though swiftly rejected, could force regulators to scrutinize OpenAI’s corporate restructuring more closely. The bid “will be more difficult to justify valuing the nonprofit’s assets at less than $97 billion if there is a concrete offer for that sum,” according to a report by The Economist. Don't Miss: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today. Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target – Many are rushing to grab 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.26/share! Musk, OpenAI’s co-founder and now rival, submitted the bid through a consortium on Feb. 11, targeting the non-profit entity that controls the company. The move escalates his feud with CEO Sam Altman over the company’s shift toward a more traditional corporate structure. “OpenAI is not for sale,” company spokesman Chris Lehane told The Economist. The timing appears strategic, as OpenAI reportedly seeks to raise approximately $40 billion from investors, including SoftBank. Musk’s bid could potentially disrupt the fundraising efforts by raising questions about proper valuation during the company’s restructuring. Trending: Are you rich? Here’s what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy. Jill Horwitz, law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that the nonprofit board’s fiduciary duty is to act according to OpenAI’s legal purpose—building safe artificial intelligence that “benefits all of humanity.” The mission-focused obligation may provide flexibility in responding to acquisition offers. Musk’s legal team has urged attorneys general in California and Delaware, where OpenAI operates, to ensure the nonprofit surrenders control at fair market value during any restructuring. While company insiders doubt state officials will acquiesce to Musk, Horwitz noted they have “clear law to apply” regarding proper valuation. See Also: Elon Musk Told The U.N. If They Could Show A Plan For Ending World Hunger He'd Donate $6 Billion – ‘I Will Sell Tesla Stock Right Now And Do It' The bid follows recent tensions over the “Stargate Project,” a $100 billion data center investment fund announced by Altman and President Donald Trump on Jan. 21. Musk publicly questioned whether the project’s backers had sufficient funding, allegations they denied. Altman responded to Musk’s bid with a facetious counteroffer on X—$9.7 billion to “buy Twitter,” as Musk’s social network was previously known. “I think he’s just trying to slow us down,” Altman told Bloomberg. “I feel for the guy. I don’t think he’s a happy person.” The offer represents another front in Musk’s competitive strategy against his largest AI rival. He launched xAI in 2023, positioning it as a direct competitor to OpenAI.

A top Democrat warned last week that the White House's  government efficiency team could disrupt tax refund processing as representatives began examining Internal Revenue Service operations during peak filing season. Gavin Kliger, a member of the Department of Government Efficiency that is being led by Elon Musk, visited IRS headquarters in Washington on Feb. 13, requesting detailed information about agency operations and staffing, according to CNN. “My office is hearing that DOGE is now at the IRS. That means Musk’s henchmen are in a position to dig through a trove of data about every taxpayer in America. And if your refund is delayed, they could very well be the reason,” Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) wrote on X. Don't Miss: Are you rich? Here’s what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy. How do billionaires pay less in income tax than you? Tax deferring is their number one strategy. The visit marks the efficiency department’s first direct engagement with the tax agency, which employs approximately 100,000 workers. According to CNN, Kliger requested information about each business unit’s responsibilities and risk factors. An email shared with CNN that was sent to IRS employees during the visit instructed staff to route queries about “high-profile visitors” through proper channels, noting the matter had been “elevated to Treasury” for further instruction. President Donald Trump authorized the IRS review earlier in the day on Feb. 13, telling reporters, “the Internal Revenue Service will be looked at like everybody else.” When asked if he expected the agency to be closed, Trump responded: “No, I don’t expect it. But I think the Internal Revenue Service will be looked at like everybody else.” Trending: Can you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved? The percentage may shock you. The audit follows an informal poll on X where Musk asked followers if they favored reviewing the IRS. The poll showed 91.2% support among respondents. The billionaire issued a poll earlier in December calling for the IRS to be "deleted," which saw 60.4% of respondents agree with the proposition. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith (R-MO) embraced the scrutiny in a letter to Acting IRS Commissioner Douglas O’Donnell. “Business as usual at the IRS is unacceptable,” Smith wrote. “Our government has not been working effectively for the American people, and it needs to change.” See Also: Elon Musk Told The U.N. If They Could Show A Plan For Ending World Hunger He'd Donate $6 Billion – ‘I Will Sell Tesla Stock Right Now And Do It' The IRS already faces hiring restrictions under Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order freezing federal employment. While the broader hiring freeze expires after 90 days, the order says that IRS restrictions will remain until the treasury secretary determines “it is in the national interest to lift the freeze.” No operational changes or layoffs have been announced. The Wall Street Journal reported that a source said Kliger did not access IRS computer systems or taxpayer information during his visit.
