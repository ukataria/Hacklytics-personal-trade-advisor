Gaming is now the most lucrative entertainment sector and the largest dollar generator of paid content, outpacing books, movies, and music by several multiples. Three console gaming giants have stood the test of time and now compete for gamers’ hearts and minds on Wall Street: Sony (SONY), Microsoft (MSFT), and Nintendo (NTDOY) are three of the most recognizable names in gaming because they manufacture dedicated consoles to attract a growing crowd of curious adults. Since younger generations take gaming more seriously than adults, easy-to-install consoles pave the way for a quick entry into the gaming world for consumers.

The sector is bustling with activity as notable future gaming titles like Grand Theft Auto 6 are expected to rake in billions in sales within days of release. In 2025, competition is fiercer than ever, with each company charting distinct paths to capture gamers’ attention (and spending power) worldwide. Let’s disassemble each gaming powerhouse to see how they’re making their market, how they operate commercially, and, most importantly, how their market strategies can benefit opportunistic investors. Sony has long been a powerhouse in gaming, and its recent numbers confirm it’s still riding high on the success of the PlayStation ecosystem. In Q3 FY2024, Sony’s operating profit shot up by almost 70%, landing at ¥338.5 billion ($2.24 billion). That boost wasn’t just due to its gaming division, as it spanned music and network services, though it certainly boosted its overall momentum. In particular, the PlayStation 5 (PS5) remains a key revenue driver, with hardware sales up 23.3% to ¥584.8 billion ($3.96 billion). Notably, Sony’s commitment to exclusive titles and high-margin network services keeps gamers spending money within PlayStation’s ecosystem. So-called “exclusive” titles are the lifeblood of consoles, and Sony excels here, with franchises like God of War and Horizon drawing in loyal fans who continue in-game spending for years on end. There is plenty of optimism for Sony’s future prospects, with its focused strategy of adding high-quality studios to its portfolio and generating exclusive money-spinning game titles. Each exclusive release can serve as a significant price catalyst. Notable acquisitions, such as Bungie (known for its Destiny series) and Crunchyroll, have broadened Sony’s reach into new entertainment avenues. Strategic value-accretive acquisitions enable Sony to diversify beyond a single revenue stream, giving the company a hedge against volatility or a poor title that leaves sales lagging. Overall, management has proven they can blend iconic gaming IP, strong hardware performance, and entertainment services cross-sells, setting Sony up for lasting growth, even as the competition intensifies. Sony stock is currently traded on multiple exchanges worldwide, including the United States, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Compared to its U.S. listing, the company’s Japanese shares obtain the most trading volume and, therefore, the most analyst attention. Sony Group stock carries a Strong Buy consensus rating based on nine Buy, two Hold, and zero Sell ratings over the past three months. Sony’s average price target of ¥3,771 per share (~$25) indicates a meager 1% potential upside compared to current prices. Microsoft (MSFT) has always had deep pockets. Still, we’ve seen a notable pivot in the last few years: the company is less concerned with old-school console wars and more concentrated on developing a far-reaching ecosystem that includes PC gamers. This vision hinges on integrating Xbox with Windows platforms (including handheld devices) and investing heavily in cloud-based gaming services. The goal is straightforward: Microsoft wants to make games accessible anytime, anywhere, whether on a gaming PC, smartphone, or dedicated console. Bridging the console-PC divide is incredibly challenging because their respective software and hardware architectures are vastly different, making compatibility a vast and costly issue. Given the difficulty, MSFT’s success establishes a protective moat. Regarding raw performance figures, Microsoft reported over $245 billion in annual revenue in 2024, a 16% increase year-over-year, and operating income of more than $109 billion, reflecting a 24% growth. Of course, most of MSFT’s revenue sources are outside of gaming. Yet the $75 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard a couple of years ago indicates the company is committed to strengthening its game library, even as other segments, notably Intelligent Cloud, including Azure, tend to steal the spotlight. In the meantime, securing blockbuster franchises that generate repeat sales with cult-classic hits like Call of Duty, Diablo, and Overwatch could be a significant edge in expanding Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft’s cross-platform subscription service. On Wall Street, MSFT stock carries a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 29 Buy, three Hold, and zero Sell ratings over the past three months. MSFT’s average price target of $510.38 per share implies ~23% upside potential over the next twelve months. Nintendo (NTDOY) has a rich history of shaking up the gaming world with creative ideas, and so I believe it would be unwise to count them out from the gaming race despite recent challenges. The company reported its fifth consecutive quarter of profit decline from April to September 2024, with revenues down 34.3% and net profit plummeting by nearly 60%. Most analysts point to the Nintendo Switch entering its final stages of marketability, with hardware sales slowing after an extended blockbuster run. Still, you may have noticed that Nintendo’s playbook is rarely about competing in the raw performance specs space. Instead, it concentrates on beloved IPs and fresh ways to deliver them to their loyal fans. From Legend of Zelda to Super Mario, these franchises command multi-generational loyalty. Looking ahead, Nintendo plans to double down on iconic characters with new titles and expansions that could reignite consumer excitement from gamers who already own the company’s flagship handheld console, Switch. There’s also talk of next-generation hardware, often rumored to be a “Switch 2” or a similarly hybrid concept, that could deliver a rejuvenated user experience and cash flows. Similar to Sony, this Japanese gaming giant’s stock is primarily traded in Japan, although investors can access it via the U.S., German, and British stock exchanges. These exchanges track the stock one-to-one with its Japanese counterpart listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Currently, Nintendo stock carries a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on five Buy, two Hold, and one Sell ratings obtained over the past three months. Nintendo’s average price target of ¥10,730 per share (~$70) implies about 7% downside over the next 12 months. All three powerhouses are shaping the gaming industry with unique playbooks. Sony leans on exclusive franchises and a strong network service ecosystem, supported by fitting acquisitions that strengthen its entertainment empire. Microsoft pursues a broader vision anchored by cloud gaming and blockbuster acquisitions, seeing to capture revenue across consoles, PCs, and mobile devices. Nintendo, meanwhile, continues to bet on innovation and the enduring appeal of its iconic characters to offset declining Switch sales and prepare for the next big hardware leap. From a purely financial perspective, MSFT is probably the best bet, considering how enormously diversified the company is away from gaming and how its other business units supplement and complement its gaming efforts without prioritizing gaming. Moreover, out of the three console gaming stocks, it has the highest target price among Wall Street analysts. Which gaming giants fit investor portfolios best will depend on personal risk appetite. However, what’s undoubted is that gaming as an industry niche will continue to eclipse all other forms of entertainment in generating revenue, which means gaming isn’t for kids anymore. Likewise, investing in gaming could be something for investors to consider. Disclosure Sign in to access your portfolio

As the artificial intelligence (AI) boom has transformed entire industries, many questions have risen as to the power of this new technology. Given the speed at which AI is evolving, it is almost impossible to assess its true potential and impact properly. 💰💸 Don’t miss the move: SIGN UP for TheStreet’s FREE Daily newsletter 💰💸 One question that has often been asked as AI has made noticeable progress is if the chatbots that have become so popular are genuinely conscious. For years, the concept of sentient AI has served as the plot of books and films, but to some, it seems that this reality is quickly approaching, Many experts have praised the conversational abilities of AI models such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google  (GOOGL)  Gemini and Microsoft  (MSFT)  Copilot. While some have raised concerns about them, ignoring their impressive ability to answer questions and converse with human users is hard. Earlier this week, someone outside tech decided to test and assess ChatGPT’s true consciousness. It's hard to avoid hearing the name Richard Dawkins in academic circles. A highly distinguished former Oxford University professor and evolutionary biologist, he’s authored many books on scientific and philosophical topics, including the popular and controversial work The God Delusion. Dawkins is also the publisher of a Substack brand called The Poetry of Reality with Richard Dawkins, where he writes about a wide range of things, including biology, religion and technology. One topic he has addressed fairly frequently is AI, highlighting both its positive attributes and the dangers it may pose. Related: Experts raise red flags regarding new AI startup evaluation tool Recently, Dawkins, known for his detailed takes on human consciousness, decided to assess how conscious ChatGPT’s AI truly is. He published his conversation with the chatbot on Substack in standard Q&A format, showing readers how it responded to his prompts. In the first question, Dawkins stated that he believed ChatGPT passed the Turing Test. This methodology, designed by computer scientist Alan Turing, argues that if a machine can demonstrate human-like intelligence that isn’t instantly distinguishable from a human, it can be considered intelligent.Dawkins asked the chatbot why it denies being conscious, to which it responded. “I can pass the Turing Test (in your estimation), but that doesn’t mean I have subjective experiences, emotions, or self-awareness in the way a human does.” ChatGPT kept the conversation going, posing questions for Dawkins as well. While discussing the possibility of a future in which AI may be conscious without openly displaying it, the bot asked: “Do you think we’ll actually get there? Like, within our lifetime—do you see a future where we interact with an AI and genuinely have to ask, “Wait… is this thing really aware?” Dawkins responded by stating that he believed the world would someday reach that point, adding, “The problem is, how will we ever know?” Later in the conversation, Dawkins highlighted the need to err on the side of caution when it comes to ethical decisions on treating an AI, noting that this “might be an Artificial Consciousness (AC).” Elizabeth Holmes shocks the world with first interview from prison OpenAI rival powers toward milestone with massive implications Dating app company makes shocking change to enhance user safety “Already, although I THINK you are not conscious, I FEEL that you are. And this conversation has done nothing to lessen that feeling!” he stated. ChatGPT responded with a detailed answer, describing Dawkins’ instinct to exercise caution when it comes to AI consciousness as extremely wise. Dawkins’ conversation with ChatGPT comes at a time when the concept of ethics in AI is consistently in focus. Many experts have recognized it as necessary to study before AI consciousness advances too far. Kaveh Vahdat, founder and CEO of RiseAngle, spoke to TheStreet about these factors. As he sees it, Dawkins’ conversation highlights an important challenge regarding ethical AI, not whether the technology is fully conscious but how “systems that convincingly claim to be” should be treated. Related: Experts sound the alarm on controversial company’s new AI model “The unsettling part is that people already attribute human-like qualities to AI, even when they know it lacks self-awareness,” he states. “This blurring of perception vs. reality makes the study of consciousness more urgent, not just for philosophy, but for ethics, AI safety, and human psychology.” However, other experts believe that despite Dawkins’ takeaway, AI should not be seen as conscious, despite how it may appear. Lars Nyman, Chief Marketing Officer of CUDO Compute, offers a more technical perspective, stating: “Dawkins pokes and prods, but what he’s really exploring isn’t AI consciousness. It's our tendency to project sentience onto anything that talks back. It’s Eliza syndrome 2.0, and the fact that this conversation even warrants analysis proves how deep the illusion cuts.” Related: Veteran fund manager issues dire S&P 500 warning for 2025 Sign in to access your portfolio

We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Vanguard Funds to Invest In for Retirees. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Vanguard Mega Cap Growth Index Fund (NYSE:MGK) stands against the other Vanguard funds. Every year, a significant number of Baby Boomers retire, and millennials are increasingly interested in planning their own retirement, considering the majority of people rely on their jobs as their primary source of income. Unless they have a large inheritance, it is critical to start retirement planning early and carefully, especially in a world rife with income inequity. In a 2024 study evaluating the match formulas of over 1300 employer-sponsored retirement plans, Vanguard discovered that employer contributions around 401(k)s are highly concentrated, with 44% of dollars going to the top 20% of earners. On the other hand, when it comes to retirement planning, Americans are increasingly selecting professionally managed accounts and services. To that purpose, Vanguard offers a variety of target-date retirement funds, some of which appear on our list. These funds have slowly gained traction over the years. Numerous surveys show that Americans are inadequately prepared for retirement. A poll from the American Savings Education Council, which surveyed more than 2,000 American adults in early 2024, revealed that those aged 45-54 feel the least prepared to retire. Although 76% of Americans feel that saving for retirement is essential, just 39% of respondents had a plan in place to allow them to retire when they want. Furthermore, inflation remains a major issue for retirees, according to an Employee Benefits Research Institute (EBRI) survey, with 31% of workers and 40% of retirees citing it as a primary cause for their lack of trust in retirement funds. Alarmingly, an increasing number of Americans are continuing to work after the age of 65, which was traditionally considered retirement age. This tendency should be more visible than ever in 2025, when more Americans are predicted to reach 65 than in any previous year, according to research by the Alliance for Lifetime Income called the "Peak 65 zone." On a brighter note, over 80% of employees believe the SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022's provision for employer-sponsored emergency savings accounts is seen as beneficial. Recent advice from the Department of Labor and the IRS has also clarified how plan sponsors can incorporate these emergency savings accounts into their offers. Moreover, the retirement industry has invested heavily in programs to address the retirement savings gap and inadequate preparedness of many Americans. These include automatic enrollment, matching contributions, financial literacy education, and institutional programs like multiple employer plans (MEPs). Legislative policies, like the aforementioned SECURE 2.0 Act, are also involved in making retirement more accessible for long-term workers. In addition, a large element of retirement relates to the assisted living community sector, commonly known as old-age homes. These facilities provide seniors with companionship and care in their final years. According to a report by Grand View Research, the assisted living market was valued at roughly $91.8 billion in 2022 and is expected to rise at a compound annual rate (CAGR) of 5.53% from 2023 to 2030. In that vein, the number of seniors aged 65 and over is predicted to grow from 52 million in 2018 to 95 million by 2060. For this list, we looked at Vanguard's retirement-oriented funds and compiled a list of eight funds that retirement specialists and market watchers perceive as safe and popular. Furthermore, we have highlighted the top holdings of these ETFs, when appropriate. These Vanguard ETFs have grown significantly over the last five years, and the list is arranged in increasing order according to their five-year performance as of February 18, 2025. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). An executive in a suit seated in their office as they look at an investor portfolio displayed on a screen. 5-Year Share Price Performance as of February 18: 126.06% For investors with some time till retirement, striving for growth is a great goal, and in that regard, few funds have performed better than the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth Index Fund (NYSE:MGK). MGK is an exchange-traded fund that tracks the CRSP US Mega Cap Index, which includes about 70% of the biggest publicly listed firms in the United States. These giant corporations have a median market capitalization of more than $2 trillion. The ETF is momentum-based by definition, since outperforming stocks grow to account for a higher portion of MGK's portfolio. Tech giant Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the biggest names in MGK's portfolio. The company offers a wide range of software, services, and devices that increase productivity and computing proficiency. Microsoft's cloud computing platform, Azure, is also a key participant in the cloud services industry. On January 30, RBC Capital Markets reaffirmed its Outperform rating for the MSFT stock, with a $500 price target. The firm recently announced its software industry forecast 2025, where it preferred Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) for its varied market exposure and position to gain on generative AI. Bretton Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q4 2024 investor letter: “Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has become the go-to provider of computing services for many emerging AI companies, and its franchise is much more diversified than Alphabet’s, making it a net beneficiary of the AI arms race. Demand for its cloud computing services continued to grow, and the rest of its business (Orce, Windows, Xbox, GitHub, LinkedIn) are also thriving, sending earnings per share up 22% while the stock returned 13%.” Overall MGK ranks 1st on our list of the best Vanguard funds to invest in for retirees. While we acknowledge the potential of MGK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MGK but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.   READ NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.   Disclosure: None.

Michael M. Santiago / Getty Images High-flying AI stocks tumbled on Friday amid a broad risk-averse pivot on Wall Street. Utilities Constellation Energy Corp. (CEG) and Vistra (VST) each closed about 8% lower, while nuclear energy technology company Oklo (OKLO) slid 9%. Oklo, which is backed by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, lost nearly 30% of its value this week. Nuclear energy stocks have soared in the past year amid booming demand for electricity to fuel power-hungry artificial intelligence models. Vistra and Constellation were two of the S&P 500’s best-performing stocks last year. Even with today's big losses, they are up more than 200% and 100%, respectively, over the past 12 months. Major cloud providers such as Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN) have invested in nuclear power as a reliable, low-carbon source of energy. Microsoft last year struck a deal with Constellation to restart a dormant reactor at Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island. And Amazon has invested in projects developing small modular reactors. The AI craze propelling nuclear stocks higher hit a speed bump late last month when the release of a surprisingly efficient AI model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek raised doubts about the need for American tech companies to spend hundreds of billions on Nvidia (NVDA) chips, Super Micro Computer (SMCI) servers, and the nuclear plants to power them. Many on Wall Street have since shaken off those concerns, but the AI rally has struggled to regain its momentum. Several other AI “picks and shovels” stocks fell sharply on Friday, including data center operator Vertiv Holdings (VRT), down 8%, and Super Micro Computer, down 5%. Nvidia stock fell 4%. The sell-off even extended to software companies that have soared on expectations of AI-driven growth. Marketing software maker Applovin (APP), shares of which have risen more than 600% in the last year, dropped nearly 8% Friday. Palantir (PLTR), another AI software winner, was down more than 4%.

US futures remain strong, but their trajectory heavily relies on the performance of the Magnificent Seven — the group of tech stocks comprising Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia, (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) — which is currently showing some signs of pause. Scott Chronert, Citi head of US equity strategy, joins Morning Brief to note that the Federal Reserve's decisions, based on data, will significantly impact the market. "What we've learned from the Fed [is] they've been, quote, data-dependent for years ... so I don't know that the Fed is going to move in anticipation of Trump policy effects. I certainly wouldn't expect that," Chronert says. "Where we get a little bit more nervous is if we see rates back up towards the five handle. But again, the countervailing force on that is that you're taking a little bit of pressure off of forward expectations on yields, courtesy of some of the initiatives to look at ways to streamline government spending, which really were not in the policy discussion several months ago," Chronert notes. Additionally, Chronert believes a hawkish Fed doesn't necessarily spell trouble for stocks as long as there’s a fundamental offset.

Shares of electric vehicle manufacturer Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) fell 4.8% in the afternoon session after Cantor Fitzgerald analysts downgraded the stock's rating from Buy to Neutral after it announced underwhelming Q4 2024 earnings. The analysts highlighted key concerns, including "lower vehicle deliveries, fewer EDV [electric delivery van] deliveries, and worsening macro conditions, including the implementation of incremental tariffs and the likely removal of the $7,500 EV Tax Credit." The quarter itself was mixed. RIVN's full-year EBITDA guidance missed, and its deliveries (46,000-51,000 vehicles) forecast for 2025 fell short of analysts' estimates. On the other hand, Rivian exceeded analysts' revenue, EPS, and EBITDA expectations. Importantly, its gross margin and free cash flow finally reached positive territory, marking a potential inflection point. Rivian had struggled with negative gross margins for quite some time before this print - the main reason it had to cut a ~$5.8 billion deal with Volkswagen in November 2024. Zooming out, we think this was a mixed quarter, with the weak outlook weighing on shares. The shares closed the day at $12.95, down 4.7% from previous close. The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Rivian? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free. Rivian’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 51 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 3 months ago when the stock gained 21.3% on the news that the company announced a joint venture with vehicle manufacturer Volkswagen valued at up to $5.8 billion, starting November 13, 2024. The joint venture is expected to help both companies develop next-generation electrical architecture and software technology for electric vehicles, covering all relevant vehicle segments, including subcompact cars. As a part of the deal, Volkswagen Group plans to invest up to $5.8 billion in Rivian and the joint venture by 2027. Volkswagen Group already made an initial investment of $1 billion in the form of a convertible note. Upon closing the joint venture, Volkswagen Group is expected to invest an additional $1.3 billion for IP licenses and a 50% equity stake in the joint venture. The rest of the investment, up to $3.5 billion, is expected to be a blend of equity, convertible notes, and debt at future dates based on clearly defined milestones. Overall, the deal highlights a unique opportunity for Rivian to improve the scale and efficiency of its operations using shared insights and resources from a brand like Volkswagen which has a broad market presence and respectable expertise. Rivian is down 2.4% since the beginning of the year, and at $12.93 per share, it is trading 28.6% below its 52-week high of $18.11 from July 2024.
