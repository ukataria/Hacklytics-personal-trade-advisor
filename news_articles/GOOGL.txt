We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks Surging on News and Analyst Calls. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against other AI stocks surging on news and analyst calls. The interest in Chinese AI startup DeepSeek remains strong, and the company itself is actively fueling its momentum. In the latest news, the company has announced that it is going to make its models’ code publicly available. The move reaffirms its commitment to open-sourcing artificial intelligence. Posting on social media platform X, the company said that its “tiny team” will open-source 5 code repositories next week. They describe the move as “small but sincere progress” and promise to share “with full transparency.” READ NOW: 10 Buzzing AI Stocks Dominating Headlines and 15 AI Stocks Every Investor Should Be Watching “These humble building blocks in our online service have been documented, deployed and battle-tested in production.” Code repositories are storage locations where developers may see and contribute to software development. They are typically published in centralized hosting services like Microsoft’s GitHub. While they may contain key company assets, DeepSeek’s V3 and R1 models were open-source which implied anyone can see or modify them for free, leading to the rapid rise and success of the startup. “As part of the open-source community, we believe that every line shared becomes collective momentum that accelerates the journey…Daily unlocks are coming soon…No ivory towers – just pure garage-energy and community-driven innovation.” Unlike many US rival firms that tend to lean toward closed-sourced models, the company has been unique given its commitment to open-source. DeepSeek’s Liang Wenfeng said last July how the firm did not prioritize commercializing its AI models. He further noted that there was soft power to be gained from open source. “Having others follow your innovation gives a great sense of accomplishment. In fact, open source is more of a cultural behavior than a commercial one, and contributing to it earns us respect”. With the new open-source code, DeepSeek will be providing the infrastructure to support the AI models that it has already publicly shared. Earlier, the company had also published a study with founder and CEO Liang Wenfeng one of the 15 co-authors. It discussed “native sparse attention”, which is designed to improve LLM efficiency in processing large data sets.

On February 21, executives from Google and Meta used the opportunity at the Techarena tech conference in Stockholm, Sweden, to discuss how Europe’s artificial intelligence industry is being held back by excessive regulation. Voicing concerns about the continent’s strict approach to regulating technologies such as AI and machine learning, Dorothy Chou, Google DeepMind’s head of public policy said that a major problem with Europe’s approach to regulating AI technology has been that the AI Act was devised before ChatGPT’s release. While the AI Act was introduced in April 2021, OpenAI launched ChatGPT in November 2022. “There is a way to use policy to create a better investment environment when it’s done in a way that promotes business…I think what’s difficult is when you are regulating on a time scale that doesn’t match the technology. I think what we need to do is both regulate to ensure that there is responsible application of technology, while also ensuring that the industry is thriving it all the right ways.” Overall, GOOGL ranks 3rd on our list of AI stocks surging on news and analyst calls. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

As the artificial intelligence (AI) boom has transformed entire industries, many questions have risen as to the power of this new technology. Given the speed at which AI is evolving, it is almost impossible to assess its true potential and impact properly. 💰💸 Don’t miss the move: SIGN UP for TheStreet’s FREE Daily newsletter 💰💸 One question that has often been asked as AI has made noticeable progress is if the chatbots that have become so popular are genuinely conscious. For years, the concept of sentient AI has served as the plot of books and films, but to some, it seems that this reality is quickly approaching, Many experts have praised the conversational abilities of AI models such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google  (GOOGL)  Gemini and Microsoft  (MSFT)  Copilot. While some have raised concerns about them, ignoring their impressive ability to answer questions and converse with human users is hard. Earlier this week, someone outside tech decided to test and assess ChatGPT’s true consciousness. It's hard to avoid hearing the name Richard Dawkins in academic circles. A highly distinguished former Oxford University professor and evolutionary biologist, he’s authored many books on scientific and philosophical topics, including the popular and controversial work The God Delusion. Dawkins is also the publisher of a Substack brand called The Poetry of Reality with Richard Dawkins, where he writes about a wide range of things, including biology, religion and technology. One topic he has addressed fairly frequently is AI, highlighting both its positive attributes and the dangers it may pose. Related: Experts raise red flags regarding new AI startup evaluation tool Recently, Dawkins, known for his detailed takes on human consciousness, decided to assess how conscious ChatGPT’s AI truly is. He published his conversation with the chatbot on Substack in standard Q&A format, showing readers how it responded to his prompts. In the first question, Dawkins stated that he believed ChatGPT passed the Turing Test. This methodology, designed by computer scientist Alan Turing, argues that if a machine can demonstrate human-like intelligence that isn’t instantly distinguishable from a human, it can be considered intelligent.Dawkins asked the chatbot why it denies being conscious, to which it responded. “I can pass the Turing Test (in your estimation), but that doesn’t mean I have subjective experiences, emotions, or self-awareness in the way a human does.” ChatGPT kept the conversation going, posing questions for Dawkins as well. While discussing the possibility of a future in which AI may be conscious without openly displaying it, the bot asked: “Do you think we’ll actually get there? Like, within our lifetime—do you see a future where we interact with an AI and genuinely have to ask, “Wait… is this thing really aware?” Dawkins responded by stating that he believed the world would someday reach that point, adding, “The problem is, how will we ever know?” Later in the conversation, Dawkins highlighted the need to err on the side of caution when it comes to ethical decisions on treating an AI, noting that this “might be an Artificial Consciousness (AC).” Elizabeth Holmes shocks the world with first interview from prison OpenAI rival powers toward milestone with massive implications Dating app company makes shocking change to enhance user safety “Already, although I THINK you are not conscious, I FEEL that you are. And this conversation has done nothing to lessen that feeling!” he stated. ChatGPT responded with a detailed answer, describing Dawkins’ instinct to exercise caution when it comes to AI consciousness as extremely wise. Dawkins’ conversation with ChatGPT comes at a time when the concept of ethics in AI is consistently in focus. Many experts have recognized it as necessary to study before AI consciousness advances too far. Kaveh Vahdat, founder and CEO of RiseAngle, spoke to TheStreet about these factors. As he sees it, Dawkins’ conversation highlights an important challenge regarding ethical AI, not whether the technology is fully conscious but how “systems that convincingly claim to be” should be treated. Related: Experts sound the alarm on controversial company’s new AI model “The unsettling part is that people already attribute human-like qualities to AI, even when they know it lacks self-awareness,” he states. “This blurring of perception vs. reality makes the study of consciousness more urgent, not just for philosophy, but for ethics, AI safety, and human psychology.” However, other experts believe that despite Dawkins’ takeaway, AI should not be seen as conscious, despite how it may appear. Lars Nyman, Chief Marketing Officer of CUDO Compute, offers a more technical perspective, stating: “Dawkins pokes and prods, but what he’s really exploring isn’t AI consciousness. It's our tendency to project sentience onto anything that talks back. It’s Eliza syndrome 2.0, and the fact that this conversation even warrants analysis proves how deep the illusion cuts.” Related: Veteran fund manager issues dire S&P 500 warning for 2025 Sign in to access your portfolio

US futures remain strong, but their trajectory heavily relies on the performance of the Magnificent Seven — the group of tech stocks comprising Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia, (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) — which is currently showing some signs of pause. Scott Chronert, Citi head of US equity strategy, joins Morning Brief to note that the Federal Reserve's decisions, based on data, will significantly impact the market. "What we've learned from the Fed [is] they've been, quote, data-dependent for years ... so I don't know that the Fed is going to move in anticipation of Trump policy effects. I certainly wouldn't expect that," Chronert says. "Where we get a little bit more nervous is if we see rates back up towards the five handle. But again, the countervailing force on that is that you're taking a little bit of pressure off of forward expectations on yields, courtesy of some of the initiatives to look at ways to streamline government spending, which really were not in the policy discussion several months ago," Chronert notes. Additionally, Chronert believes a hawkish Fed doesn't necessarily spell trouble for stocks as long as there’s a fundamental offset.

President Donald Trump launched his second term with a series of executive actions that could have broad economic implications, and corporate leaders have taken note. At his inauguration, the key figures from the tech industry, including Meta META CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon AMZN CEO Jeff Bezos, and Alphabet GOOG CEO Sundar Pichai, were seated in spots traditionally reserved for close family members and VIP guests. The re-election of Donald Trump infused record highs for the technology and cryptocurrency markets in November. One of Trump’s first executive actions was to roll back regulations imposed by the previous administration on artificial intelligence (AI). By rescinding these restrictions, his administration aims to “clear a path for the United States to act decisively to retain global leadership in artificial intelligence,” according to an official executive order. This move is expected to fuel rapid advancements in AI innovation and development. In fact, generative AI has surged in relevance since Trump’s first term. The Trump administration had previously made concerted efforts to promote AI. He signed the American AI Initiative executive order on Feb. 11, 2019. The order pledged to double AI research investment and established the first set of national AI research institutes. The order also included a plan for AI technical standards and established guidance for the federal government’s use of AI. Trump also signed an executive order on Dec. 3, 2020, promoting the use of trustworthy AI in the federal government. It shows that AI stocks and ETFs should have great days during Trump’s ruling. In January itself, President Donald Trump announced a $500 billion AI infrastructure initiative, spearheading a new company called Stargate. Initial funding for the project will come from SoftBank (SFTBY), OpenAI, Oracle (ORCL), and UAE-based MGX. This ambitious project is designed to accelerate AI research and development over the next four years. While some investors remain cautious about Trump’s broader economic policies — such as mass deportations, deregulation and tariffs — the tech sector appears to be among the primary beneficiaries of his second term. With both the House and Senate under Republican control, the administration is expected to push forward an aggressive pro-business agenda that could create a favorable climate for technology firms to expand and innovate. Under the Biden administration, antitrust measures targeted big players like Google, Amazon and Apple, with the FTC attempting to curb their market dominance. Trump, however, has indicated a more lenient stance on breaking up Big Tech. This could affect the ongoing cases against Big Tech, including efforts to break up Alphabet’s Google GOOGL due to its dominance in online search. While Trump is likely to continue several antitrust cases against major tech companies — many of which began during his first term — he recently expressed skepticism about a potential Google breakup. In fact, in October, Trump questioned whether dismantling Google would harm the company too severely. Hence, overall, we can expect tech stocks to remain better-positioned in the Trump 2.0 era.
